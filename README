Use these files and functions to connect and authenticate with the xero.com API for a public App.

The functions used are inside the functions folder.

The other files are named accordingly (eg request-token.asp) etc.

Edit the files and add your consumer key and secret. Upload them to your web-server and browse to the request-token.asp file. If everything goes to plan you should be redirected to Xero to login. Once you login you should be faced with a form to allow your app to have access to your xero account.

Once set it should then redirect to the callback.asp page to get the actual token and secret.

The callback.asp file is the one you have to set in Xero on the "Callback domain" field on your App page.
